description: >-
  The \c{AAM} instruction converts the result of a multiplication of two BCD digits to a valid 2-digit BCD number.

  This instruction will not be useful unless it immediately follows an \instr{MUL} instruction.

  Traditionally, this instruction is called "ASCII Adjust After Multiplication".
  This would lead one to believe that it works on ASCII digits (\c{030h} (\c{0}) through \c{039h} (\c{9})), however this would be incorrect.
  This instruction \i{actually} operates on BCD digits (\c{00h} (\c{0}) through \c{09h} (\c{9})).

  Due to a quirk of history, this instruction encodes the base of the result in the instruction (the second byte).
  As such, it is possible to have this instruction work on other bases through an immediate 8 bit operand.
  Such methods are not guaranteed to be supported by your assembler, and in such situations, one must encode the instruction directly.

  This instruction is not valid in 64-bit mode, and if encountered, the processor will raise a \c{#UD} exception.
operation: >-
  pub fn aam(imm8: u8) {
    if MODE == 64 {
      #UD;
    } else {
      AH = AL / imm8;
      AL = AL % imm8;
    }
  }
flags: >-
  The \reg{SF}, \reg{ZF}, and \reg{PF} flags are set according to the resulting binary value in the AL register.
  The \reg{OF}, \reg{AF}, and \reg{CF} flags are undefined.
exceptions:
  protected:
    "#DE": If an immediate value of 0 is used.
    "#UD": If the \instr{LOCK} prefix is used.
  real: Same exceptions as protected mode.
  virtual: Same exceptions as protected mode.
  compatibility: Same exceptions as protected mode.
  long:
    "#UD": If in 64-bit mode.
