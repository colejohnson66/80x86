description: >-
  The \c{ADCX} instruction adds the destination operand, the source operand, and the \reg{CF} flag and stores the result in the destination operand.

  This instruction is designed for use in multibyte additions such as in arbitrary precision arithmetic.
  The difference between this instruction and \instr{ADC} is that this one allows the creation of two "carry chains" \en{} one using \reg{CF} (this one) and one using \reg{OF} (\instr{ADOX}).

  In 64 bit mode, the default operand size is 32 bits, but \c{REX.W} will change it to 64 bits.
operation: >-
  pub fn adcx_op32(dest: &mut u32, src: u32) {
    *dest = *dest + src + CF;
  }

  pub fn adcx_op64(dest: &mut u64, src: u64) {
    *dest = *dest + src + CF;
  }
flags: >-
  \reg{CF} is updated based on the result. The \reg{OF}, \reg{SF}, \reg{ZF}, \reg{AF}, and \reg{PF} flags are unmodified.
