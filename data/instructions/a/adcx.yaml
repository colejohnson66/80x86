description: >-
  The \c{ADCX} instruction adds the destination operand, the source operand, and the \reg{CF} flag and stores the result in the destination operand.

  This instruction is designed for use in multibyte additions such as in arbitrary precision arithmetic.
  The difference between this instruction and \instr{ADC} is that this one allows the creation of two "carry chains" \en{} one using \reg{CF} (this one) and one using \reg{OF} (\instr{ADOX}).

  In 64 bit mode, the default operand size is 32 bits, but \c{REX.W} will change it to 64 bits.
operation: >-
  public void ADCX_32(ref uint dest, uint src)
  {
    dest = dest + src + CF;
  }

  public void ADCX_64(ref ulong dest, ulong src)
  {
    dest = dest + src + CF;
  }
flags:
  CF: Set according to the result.
  PF: Unmodified.
  AF: Unmodified.
  ZF: Unmodified.
