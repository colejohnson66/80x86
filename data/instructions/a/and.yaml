description: >-
  The \c{AND} instruction performs a logical AND with the destination operand against the source operand and stores the result in the destination operand.

  This instruction can be used with the \instr{LOCK} prefix to allow atomic execution.

  In 64 bit mode, the default operand size is 32 bits, but \c{REX.W} will change it to 64 bits.
operation: |-
  pub fn and<T>(dest: &mut T, src: T) {
    *dest = *dest & src;
  }
flags: >-
  The \reg{OF} and \reg{CF} flags are cleared.
  The \reg{SF}, \reg{ZF}, and \reg{PF} flags are set according to the result.
  The \reg{AF} flag is undefined.
exceptions:
  protected:
    "#GP(0)":
      - If the destination is located in a non-writable segment.
      - If a memory operand effective address is outside the \reg{CS}, \reg{DS}, \reg{ES}, \reg{FS}, or \reg{GS} segment limit.
      - If the \reg{DS}, \reg{ES}, \reg{FS}, or \reg{GS} register is used to access memory and it contains a \c{NULL} segment selector.
    "#SS(0)": If a memory operand effective address is outside the \reg{SS} segment limit.
    "#PF(fault-code)": If a page fault occurs.
    "#AC(0)": If alignment checking is enabled and an unaligned memory reference is made while the current privilege level is 3.
    "#UD": If the \instr{LOCK} prefix is used but the destination is not a memory operand.
  real:
    "#GP": If a memory operand effective address is outside the \reg{CS}, \reg{DS}, \reg{ES}, \reg{FS}, or \reg{GS} segment limit.
    "#SS": If a memory operand effective address is outside the \reg{SS} segment limit.
    "#UD": If the \instr{LOCK} prefix is used but the destination is not a memory operand.
  virtual:
    "#GP(0)": If a memory operand effective address is outside the \reg{CS}, \reg{DS}, \reg{ES}, \reg{FS}, or \reg{GS} segment limit.
    "#SS(0)": If a memory operand effective address is outside the \reg{SS} segment limit.
    "#PF(fault-code)": If a page fault occurs.
    "#AC(0)": If alignment checking is enabled and an unaligned memory reference is made.
    "#UD": If the \instr{LOCK} prefix is used but the destination is not a memory operand.
  compatibility: Same exceptions as in protected mode.
  long:
    "#SS(0)": If a memory address referencing the \reg{SS} segment is in a non-canonical form.
    "#GP(0)": If a memory operand address is in a non-canonical form.
    "#PF(fault-code)": If a page fault occurs.
    "#AC(0)": If alignment checking is enabled and an unaligned memory reference is made while the current privilege level is 3.
    "#UD": If the \instr{LOCK} prefix is used but the destination is not a memory operand.
