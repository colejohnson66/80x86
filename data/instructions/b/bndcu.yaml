description: >-
  The \c{BNDCU} instruction compares the address in the second source operand (a GPR or memory location) against the upper bound (\c{UB}) in the 1's complemented version of the first source operand (a bound register).
  If the second source operand is greater, a \c{#BR} exception is thrown, and \c{BNDSTATUS} is set to \c{1h}.

  This instruction is similar to the \instr{BNDCN} instruction, except this one inverts the bound register (i.e. finds the one's complemented form) before comparison.
  Generally, this instruction is the one that would be used (not \c{BNDCN}).
  This is because the upper bound is actually \i{stored} in inverted (1's complement) form, so any comparisons against it should have it inverted first.

  If the second source operand is a general purpose register, the value contained in it is treated as the address to compare against.
  If, however, it is a memory location, the effective address is calculated (see \instr{LEA}) and used in the comparison.
  At no time is memory accessed, and the flags are untouched.

  Which instruction form (32 or 64 bit) is used depends on the operating mode of the processor.
  In 16 and 32 bit mode, the 32 bit form is used, and, in 64 bit mode, the 64 bit form is used.
  If a memory address is used as the second source operand, this distinction is irrelevant.

exceptions:
  protected:
    "#BR": If the upper bounds check fails.
    "#UD":
      - If the \instr{LOCK} prefix is used.
      - If \c{ModRM.r/m} does not encode \c{BND0} through \c{BND3} (i.e. contains a 4, 5, 6, or 7).
      - If the address size overload prefix (\c{67h}) is used when \c{CS.D} is \c{1}.
      - If the address size overload prefix is \i{not} used when \c{CS.D} is \c{0}.
  real:
    "#BR": If the upper bounds check fails.
    "#UD":
      - If the \instr{LOCK} prefix is used.
      - If \c{ModRM.r/m} does not encode \c{BND0} through \c{BND3} (i.e. contains a 4, 5, 6, or 7).
      - If 16 bit addressing is used.
  virtual: Same exceptions as real mode.
  compatibility: Same exceptions as protected mode.
  long:
    "#BR": If the upper bounds check fails.
    "#UD":
      - If the \instr{LOCK} prefix is used.
      - If \c{ModRM.r/m} does not encode \c{BND0} through \c{BND3} (i.e. contains any of 4 through 15).
      - If the address size overload prefix (\c{67h}) is used when \c{CS.D} is \c{1}.
      - If the address size overload prefix is \i{not} used when \c{CS.D} is \c{0}.

  list:
    - >-
      The overview table only mentions 32 and 64 bit mode support.
      However, this instruction is supported in all modes.
    - >-
      The "Encoding" section incorrectly lists the first operand (the bound register) as being written to.
      It is actually only read.
