title: Load Extended Bounds Using Address Translation
opcode:
  - opcode: NP 0F 1A /r
    mnemonic: BNDLDX \i{bnd}, \i{mib}
    encoding: RM
    validity:
      16: valid
      32: valid
      64: valid
    cpuid: MPX
    description: >-
      Load the bounds stored in a bound table entry (BTE) from \i{mib} into \i{bnd}.
encoding:
  operands: 2
  encodings:
    RM:
      - ModRM.reg[w]
      - SIB.base[r] + SIB.index[r]
description: >-
  The \c{BNDLDX} instruction conditionally loads the destination operand with the bounds referenced at the address pointed to by the source operand.
  This is conditional on the value contained in the register referenced in the SIB's index field matching the value stored in the bounds table entry.
  If the check fails, the destination is set to the \c{INIT} bounds value (lower = \c{0}, upper = \c{0}), allowing access to all available memory.

  The second source operand \i{must} be a memory operand encoded using an SIB byte.
  The \c{base} field of the SIB byte contains the address of the bounds table, and the \c{index} field contains the buffer's offset.
  The \c{scale} field is ignored (treated as \c{0b00} (scale of 1)).
  If a displacement is provided, it is added to the \c{base} register's value.
  At no time is memory referenced by the SIB byte accessed (the memory contained at the address referenced by the \c{base} \i{is}, however), and the flags are untouched.

  Which instruction form (32 or 64 bit) is used depends on the operating mode of the processor.
  In 16 and 32 bit mode, the 32 bit form is used, and, in 64 bit mode, the 64 bit form is used.
  If a memory address is used as the second source operand, this distinction is irrelevant.

    If \c{CPL} (protection ring) is less than 3, the supervisor \c{MAWA} (\c{MAWAS}) is used, which is 0.
    Otherwise, the user \c{MAWA} (\c{MAWAU}) is used; it's value is enumerated in \cpuid{eax,07,ecx,00,,ecx,mawau,21..17}.
